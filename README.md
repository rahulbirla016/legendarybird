# legendarybird

## Info

Description: This is a Basic game in phaser3.js framework.

Steps to Run:
1. You will need to run a web server. There is more info on the official phaser3.js website tutorial https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3/part2.
    You could use Wamp server. Here I used the mongoose web server.
2. After downloading mongoose, you could run the executable `mongoose.exe` in a terminal.
3. After running mongoose, you could access the game at localhost:8000 followed by the path to game.html that is relative to where mongoose is running. (e.g., localhost:8000/Downloads/legendarybird/game.html).
